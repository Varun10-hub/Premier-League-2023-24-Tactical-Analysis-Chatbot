# Premier League Tactical Analysis AI Assistant

## Project Overview
This project leverages AI to generate in-depth tactical insights for the Premier League 2023/24 season. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model to analyze team tactics, predict match outcomes, and provide detailed analysis of playing styles.

## Features
- In-depth tactical analysis of Premier League teams
- Match outcome predictions with tactical reasoning
- Data visualization including:
  - Spider charts for attacking metrics (xG, xAG, assists, goals, etc.)
  - Bar charts comparing expected vs. actual goals
  - Scatter plots highlighting possession vs. tackles in the final third
- Interactive chatbot interface for querying tactical insights

## Technologies Used
- OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo API
- Python
- Streamlit (for web application)
- Ngrok (for hosting)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages
3. Set up environment variables for API keys:
- OpenAI API key
- Ngrok authentication token
4. Run the Streamlit app
  
## Usage
1. Start the application
2. Use the chat interface to ask questions about Premier League tactics
3. Request visualizations for specific teams or metrics
4. Explore match predictions and tactical analyses

## Note on API Keys
This project requires API keys for OpenAI and Ngrok. For security reasons, these are not included in the repository. Users must provide their own API keys to run the application.

## Future Improvements
- Expand analysis to other football leagues
- Implement more advanced statistical models for predictions
- Add historical data analysis for team performance trends
